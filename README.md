# SpaceExploration
Using HTML and CSS, I was able to build a space exploration site by using headers, button, image, and title tags as the hero. Then, I went over to CSS to style the website where I added an animated galaxy bacgkround to fit the theme in addition to implementing margins, padding, and fonts.
